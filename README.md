# Park's Portfolio

This is my first portfolio web project with Springboot and React.js. I was frustrated where to put my past project of mine cuz there are lots of blogs I can use but didn't really like their UI. So I decided to build my own this time. Automated test/build added in this project by using Travis CI and deploy as well with AWS CodeDeploy and S3.
